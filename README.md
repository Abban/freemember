# FreeMember: Free your member templates!

FreeMember is a free add-on for ExpressionEngine 2.2+, which adds powerful inline member profile
& authentication tags using the native EE template syntax, instead of using the ugly and inflexible
static member templates bundled with EE.

## Installation

1. Copy the `freemember` folder to `system/expressionengine/third_party` on your server.
2. Visit Add-ons > Modules > FreeMember on your server, and click Install next to FreeMember.

If you are upgrading from FreeMember 1.x, please note that FreeMember is now a module, and you
must enable it by following the above instructions.
